Implement reference counting:

  foo1 = new_foo_closure(...);
  foo2 = clone_foo( foo1 ); /* actually returns foo1 so foo1 == foo2 */
  free_foo(foo1);           /* ref count back to 1 */
  free_foo(foo2);           /* actually freed */

Implement 'self' context arg which points to the closure itself.

Build a closure address -> closure number index so we don't depend on
the closure addresses being in ascending order. Will also be useful to
be able to look up the closure to e.g. access it's curried args.

Think About
===========

Suicidal / one-shot closures.
